You can use Auto Scaling to manage Amazon EC2 capacity automatically, maintain the right number of instances for your application, 
operate a healthy group of instances, and scale it according to your needs

You create collections of EC2 instances, called Auto Scaling groups
You can specify the minimum number of instances in each Auto Scaling group, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling ensures that your group never 
goes below this size. You can specify the maximum number of instances in each Auto Scaling group,and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling ensures 
that your group never goes above this size.

or decreases.
