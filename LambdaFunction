How to Create Lambda Function:
1. "Author from scratch"
2. runtimes : Go, Java, nodejs, python, Ruby, .Net
3. Choose Role
4. in the configuration, there are below tabs
  1. Designer
  2. Function Code
  3. environment variables.
  4. tags
  5. basic settings
  6. VPC
  7. Concurrency
  8. Asynchronous invocation
  9. Database proxies (preview)
5. In the function code, we have 3 options.
  1. EDIT code inline.
  2. upload a zip file. use this option when you want to use a modules/libraries. say kafka module in pyhton code to be used.
  3. if the zip file is grater then 10 MB, use upload a file from Amazon s3.



6. What is AWS lambda:  AWS lambda lets you run the code without provisioning or managing servers. we pay for only till the lambda 
funtionis computed. There is no charge if the code isnt running.Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with 
high availability. You can set up your code to automatically trigger from other AWS services or call it directly from any web or mobile app.
7.  What is serverless computing: Serverless computing allows you to build and run applications and services without thinking about 
servers.With serverless computing, your application still runs on servers, but all the server management is done by AWS. 
At the core of serverless computing is AWS Lambda, which lets you run your code without provisioning or managing servers.
8. Services That Lambda Reads Events From:
Amazon Kinesis
Amazon DynamoDB
Amazon Simple Queue Service

9. Services That Invoke Lambda Functions Synchronously: For synchronous invocation, the other service waits for the response from your 
function and might retry on errors.
Elastic Load Balancing (Application Load Balancer)
Amazon Cognito
Amazon Lex
Amazon Alexa
Amazon API Gateway
Amazon CloudFront (Lambda@Edge)
Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
AWS Step Functions
Amazon Simple Storage Service Batch

10. For asynchronous invocation, Lambda queues the event before passing it to your function. 
The other service gets a success response as soon as the event is queued and isn't aware of what happens afterwards. 
If an error occurs, Lambda handles retries, and can send failed events to a dead-letter queue that you configure.
Services That Invoke Lambda Functions Asynchronously:
Amazon Simple Storage Service
Amazon Simple Notification Service
Amazon Simple Email Service
AWS CloudFormation
Amazon CloudWatch Logs
Amazon CloudWatch Events
AWS CodeCommit
AWS Config
AWS IoT
AWS IoT Events
AWS CodePipeline
