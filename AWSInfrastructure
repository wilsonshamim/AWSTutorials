AWS Global Infrastructure:
The AWS Cloud spans 61 Availability Zones within 20 geographic regions around the world, with announced plans for 12 more Availability 
Zones and four more AWS Regions in Bahrain, Cape Town, Hong Kong SAR, and Milan.

  Edge locations:

AWS Regions provide multiple (typically 3) physically separated and isolated Availability Zones which are connected with low latency,
high throughput, and highly redundant networking. 
These Availability Zones offer AWS customers an easier and more effective way to design and operate applications and databases, 
making them more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than traditional singledatacenter infrastructures or multi-datacenter
infrastructures.
