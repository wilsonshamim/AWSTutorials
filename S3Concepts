Simple storage service(S3):
1. object based storage service.
2. Serverless storage in the cloud.
3. dont worry about filesystem or disk space.

what is object storage or object based storage:
its a data sotrage archicture that manage data as objects as opposed to other storage like 
file systems which manage data as files and hirarchy.
and block storage which manages data as blocks within sectors and tracks.

S3 provide an unlimited storage.
S3 console provides an interface to upload and access data.

S3 objects:
objects contains the data. they are like files. S3 can store data from 0 B to 5TB in size.
object may consists of 
1. key: name of the object
2. value: the data itself made up of sequence of bytes.
3. version id:  when versioning enabled, version of the object.
4. metadata: additional information attached to the object.

S3 Buckets:
Buckets holds objects. buckets can have folders which in turn holds objects.

S3 is the universal namespace. so buckets names must be unique (think like haveing a domain name)
