Benefits of AWS Security
• Keep Your Data Safe: The AWS infrastructure puts strong safeguards in place to help protect your privacy. All data is stored in highly
secure AWS data centers.
• Meet Compliance Requirements: AWS manages dozens of
compliance programs in its infrastructure. This means that segments of your compliance have already been completed.
• Save Money: Cut costs by using AWS data centers. Maintain the highest standard of security without having to manage your own facility
• Scale Quickly: Security scales with your AWS Cloud usage. No matter the size of your business, the AWS infrastructure is designed to 
keep your data safe.

Compliance
AWS Cloud Compliance enables you to understand the robust controls in place at AWS to maintain security and data protection in the cloud.
As systems are built on top of AWS Cloud infrastructure, compliance responsibilities will be shared. By tying together governance-focused, 
audit-friendly service features with applicable compliance or audit standards, AWS Compliance enablers build on traditional programs.
This helps customers to establish and operate in an AWS security control environment
